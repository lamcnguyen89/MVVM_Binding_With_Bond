# MVVM_Binding_With_Bond

Binding is essentially the process of allowing objects in your code to be updated real-time when a change is made. A framework called Swift Bond is used and makes it much easier to do this process of binding, especially when creating a project using the MVVM architecture.
<br />

## Prerequisites and Deployment

- Mac Computer to develop for iOS
- XCode 11.0 or later
- Homebrew to install Pod Package Manager
- Cocoapods package manager

- If You manage to figure out how to initiate cocoapods in the project (Just Google it), in your podfile write this:
<br/>
pod 'Bond'
<br />
pod 'DatePickerCell'

<br />
This will install the Swift Bond and Date Picker cocoapod frameworks required for this project.
